# Svensson-Model-for-Yield-Curve
This project provides a script for calculating the Yield Curve using the Svensson Model (1994), which is currently used by the European Central Bank (ECB). The implementation allows for the estimation of interest rate term structures based on bond market data.
In this project, Italian Government Bonds are used for computations.
